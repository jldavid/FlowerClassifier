# FlowerClassifier
Confoo 2018 - Add Machine Learning to your iOS App with Core ML

* Note this demo requires iOS 11 and Xcode 9.2
* The FlowerClassifier.mlmodel file was intentionally omitted from this project (it's 229.1MB and Github doesn't allow binaries that large)
* You will need to download the ModelML file and include it in the project to make it work (otherwise the project will throw errors and complain about a missing model)
* Here is the download link for FlowerClassifier.mlmodel ()
